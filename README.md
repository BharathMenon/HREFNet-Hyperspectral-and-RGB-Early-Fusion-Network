# HREFNet-Hyperspectral-and-RGB-Early-Fusion-Network
Hyperspectral imaging captures detailed spectral signatures in the 400â€“950 nm 
range, allowing for the identification of early-stage stress before visible symptoms 
appear. RGB imaging complements this by providing high-resolution spatial 
information for detecting visible symptoms and localizing pest infestations. The framework is 
 trained and validated on publicly available datasets, including the Chickpea 
Disease Dataset, PlantVillage, and Hyperspectral Crop Disease Dataset (HCD). 
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 
and F1-score, with ablation studies conducted to assess the contributions of 
SSL, AHAM, and multi-modal fusion. 
The final model will be optimized for real-time deployment, enabling farmers to 
monitor crop health continuously and implement timely interventions. By 
combining the strengths of hyperspectral and RGB imaging with advanced 
machine learning, this framework aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective 
solution for precision agriculture, helping to reduce yield losses, minimize 
pesticide use, and promote sustainable farming practices.
